When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	
	I would want to use a remote repository when I need to share my work,
	or work together with other people. Also, it's a backup.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	Because you might use the remote repository as a production ready version, for example,
	and you want your local version more experimental. Or maybe you don't want to pull 
	commits from other people yet, because they can interfere with your local ones.
