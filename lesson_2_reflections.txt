What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository, a new hidden folder named .git 
	is created. This folder contains the necessary metadata for tracking 
	the files for changes. We need to do this in order to setup the 
	inner workings of file-tracking.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
	
	I think the staging area is a list of the files to be commited, and the 
	working directory is the actual files on the folder right now.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	You can always only include the involved files on the logical change,
	altough you may have changed a lot more files, the staging area gives you 
	the opportunity to only commit the changes that are involved in a logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? 
How would branches help?
	
	Branches could help to try out new things, experimental features, that you aren't
	completely sure to include at this time. Also, it could be used for collaboration.
	Branches help us keep the history clean by separating our changes logically.
