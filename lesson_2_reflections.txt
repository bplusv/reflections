What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository, a new hidden folder named .git 
	is created. This folder contains the necessary metadata for tracking 
	the files for changes. We need to do this in order to setup the 
	inner workings of file-tracking.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
	
	I think the staging area is a list of the files to be commited, and the 
	working directory is the actual files on the folder right now.
